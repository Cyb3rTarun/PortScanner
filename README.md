# PortScanner üñ•Ô∏è
## Overview :-
A portScanner tool which helps you to find out the Open Ports that are availabe on the target system. It works on the principle of TCP Connection. By using the socket module we will try to establish a connection to the destination Port Address. And if the connection is successfull tell us that the port is Open for connection.

### Popular Port Numbers :-

- Port 22 (tcp) ‚Äì Secure Shell (SSH) protocol for secure logins, ftp, and port forwarding.
- Port 23 (tcp) ‚Äì Telnet protocol for unencrypted text commutations
